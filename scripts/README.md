# Repository scripts

Run scripts from the repository root. Generated environments and diagnostic outputs
are ignored or should be written below `/tmp`; media and model artifacts must not be
committed.

## Setup

```bash
./scripts/setup/install-system-dependencies.sh
./scripts/setup/create-local-environment.sh
```

The local environment uses Python 3.12 to match `deployments/Dockerfile`.
Set `INSTALL_MODELS=0` when preparing only the media and CV diagnostic environment;
normal full extraction installs the CPU PyTorch and Whisper dependencies.

## Diagnostic fixture and full extraction

```bash
./scripts/fixtures/create-diagnostic-video.sh /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.mp4
./scripts/run/generate-capsule.sh \
  /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.mp4 \
  /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.json
./scripts/diagnostics/evaluate-capsule.py /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.json
```

If the development network blocks the production CPU PyTorch wheel index, exercise
the complete media/audio/capsule assembly with the deterministic fixture transcriber:

```bash
./scripts/diagnostics/generate-fixture-capsule.py \
  /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.mp4 \
  /tmp/video-capsule-diagnostic.json
```

This verifies that audio is extracted and passed to a transcriber, but it does not
benchmark Whisper or transcription accuracy.

## Timestamp evidence

```bash
./scripts/diagnostics/probe-media.sh video.mp4 /tmp/video-probe
./scripts/diagnostics/extract-keyframes-debug.sh video.mp4 /tmp/keyframe-debug
```

The debug extractor retains images, FFmpeg logs, and a CSV manifest mapping filename
tokens to `showinfo` timestamps.
